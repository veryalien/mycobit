# mycobpibit

This is the version of mycobit for the banana pi bpi:bit.

There are a few differences to mycobit for the micro:bit as the bpi:bit has a RGB LED 5x5 display. Additional colour commands have been included to allow changing the pixel colours on the display.

You can find the full instruction set and info in the mycobpibit doc folder.

All of the other features of mycobit for the micro:bit will work with mycobpibit, please refer to the main README for more details.

This version will not work on the micro:bit.

mycobpibit is written in micropython, you will need to have micropyhon installed on your bpi:bit to use mycobpibit. You can find the installation instructions here, get ready to use chrome and translate to english!
