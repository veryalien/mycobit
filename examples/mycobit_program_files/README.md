# mycobit program files

These pre-entered program files allow you to use different mycobit programs without using the (annoying editor?) and the micro:bit buttons!

Download and copy a pre-defined mycobit program file to your mu-code folder and rename the file to exactly the name: mycobit

Open the mu-editor

Connect a micro:bit, with the mycobit system already installed (see the main README file for setup details).

Open the mu files tab.

Drag the mycobit file from the 'Files on your computer:' list to the 'Files on your micro:bit:' list.

If there is already a file called mycobit, agree that you want to overwrite the file.

The file should be successfully copied.

Reset the micro:bit and the pre-defined mycobit program will run.

You can also reset the micro:bit with button B held down to start the editor if you want to look at the mycobit program commands.
